            <h2>Theater</h2> 
            <p>The NYUAD Theater Program is an academic and artistic laboratory dedicated to theater research, scholarship and 
                practice. Reflecting the global vision of NYUAD, a cosmopolitan liberal arts university, we provide a rigorous 
                physical-based approach to artist training, a solid scholarly foundation in theater history, theory and criticism, 
                and exposure to a variety of transglobal cultural practices through the study of theater both here and abroad. 
                For NYUAD theater majors, making and thinking culture are inseparable tasks. Our aim is to 
                develop artist-citizens whose theatrical contributions will expand the limits of the field and make a difference in the world.

            <h2>Music</h2> 
            <p>The Music Program is committed to educating a new generation of musicians capable of understanding and 
                making music on a transnational and interdisciplinary scale, in an eclectic yet rigorous fashion. 
                Students majoring in music acquire skills in composition, technology, and performance, and they develop 
                ways to consider music from a theoretical and historical perspective. The program offers students the opportunity 
                to learn firsthand about a diverse range of traditional and popular musics spanning various cultures and styles.

            <h2>Film & New Media</h2> 
            <p>Film and New Media at NYUAD integrates the making of film and new media with the study of their histories, conventions, 
                and practices. Students take both practice and studies courses, and finish their degree with a capstone project that 
                reflects the historical and cultural contexts of their interests and studies. The intermingling of studies and practice 
                and the relatively easy traffic between majors and concentrations at NYUAD enables Film and New Media majors to connect 
                their study to a broad range of other fields and disciplines, such as Interactive Media, Arab Crossroads, Art and Art 
                History, Literature and Creative Writing, Computer Science, Social Research and Public Policy, and Theater.

            <h2>Art & Art History</h2> 
            <p>From pre-historic cave art to the digital media of today, human beings across the globe and through the ages have
                 used visual forms to understand and shape their world. Painting, sculpture, architecture as well as ornament, design,
                  and photography have provided rich traditions of visual expression and communication, and the development of new media
                   has greatly expanded this visual repertoire. Different cultures, in different places and at different times, 
                   have valued and conceptualized vision and made use of the visual arts in a variety of ways. The visual arts 
                   investigate and re-imagine the physical, social, cultural, and spiritual spheres of human existence and offer 
                   arguments about and interpretations of these realms.

            <h2>Interactive Media</h2> 
            <p>From the electric telegraph to personal computers, from the participatory web to intelligent networks, our tools 
                for communication and media production are constantly changing the ways we connect with one another. Interactive 
                Mediaâ€™s mission aims to make sense of these developments by demystifying their inner-workings and leveraging them 
                as a means for creative expression, communication, and participation. In practice, the program rests at the 
                convergence of art, design, communications, computer science, and engineering. The technologies are posited not as
                 an end in themselves but as a means to address fundamental questions pertaining to the human condition, complex 
                 relationships between ourselves and our mediated environment, and what it means to be an active participant in a 
                 world increasingly informed by computation and automation.
